      This is a Lorenz water wheel. Freely-swinging buckets with small
      holes in the bottom are arranged around the outside of a loose
      wheel. Water flows into the bucket at the top of the wheel,
      filling it up. As it gets heavier it pulls down on the wheel,
      spinning it.

      This simulation is chaotic: even though the behavior of the
      system is deterministic it is <i>highly</i> sensitive to initial
      conditions. The animation you see above is unique: no one saw
      this particular variation before, nor will anyone again. If you
      refresh the page you'll be given a new wheel with unique initial
      conditions (well, one out of the 2^128 possible starting
      conditions, since this is running inside of a digital computer).
    </p>

      On the state space plot you should be able to see the state
      orbiting two attractors. It's the classic butterfly image that
      gives the phenomenon its name. The state space plot will look
      smoother with more buckets, being perfectly smooth at an
      infinite amount of buckets. Your mouse cannot possibly survive
      that much clicking, so don't try it.
